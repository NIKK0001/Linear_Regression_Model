# Linear_Regression_Model
Implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms
🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
This project implements a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on key features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.

📌 Objective
The goal is to build a simple yet effective regression model that estimates house prices using a few core variables. This serves as a foundational project for understanding supervised machine learning with a real-world dataset.

📂 Dataset
Source: Kaggle - House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

The dataset includes various features, but this project focuses on:

GrLivArea (Above grade living area in square feet)

BedroomAbvGr (Number of bedrooms)

FullBath (Number of full bathrooms)

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python

Pandas & NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

Scikit-learn (for linear regression modeling and evaluation)

📊 Workflow
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and selecting relevant features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing relationships between features and price.

Model Training: Applying Linear Regression.

Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like RMSE and R² Score.

📈 Results
The model provides an estimate of house prices based on just a few key features, demonstrating how even simple linear models can extract valuable insights from real estate data.

🚀 Future Improvements
Incorporate more features (e.g., neighborhood, year built).

Use advanced models (Ridge, Lasso, or XGBoost).

Perform hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.
